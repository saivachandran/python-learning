# What is NumPy and Why We Need It in MLOps Preparation

## üß† What is NumPy?

**NumPy (Numerical Python)** is a powerful Python library for numerical computing.  
It provides high-performance **multi-dimensional arrays (ndarrays)** and tools to operate on them efficiently.

It‚Äôs the foundation for most data science and machine learning workflows ‚Äî libraries like **Pandas, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and PyTorch** depend heavily on NumPy.

## üöÄ Why We Need NumPy in MLOps Preparation

In MLOps (Machine Learning Operations), NumPy is essential for:

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Cleaning, transforming, and normalizing large datasets before training models.
   - Example: Standardizing pixel values in image datasets.

2. **Feature Engineering**
   - Generating new input features from raw data using mathematical transformations.
   - Example: Applying `np.log()`, `np.mean()`, or `np.std()` to scale features.

3. **Matrix and Vector Operations**
   - Machine learning algorithms (like Linear Regression, PCA) rely on linear algebra.
   - Example: `np.dot(X, w)` for matrix multiplication.

4. **Integration with ML Libraries**
   - Frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch internally convert data to NumPy arrays.

5. **Model Evaluation and Metrics**
   - Calculating MSE, accuracy, and other metrics using NumPy operations.

6. **Efficient Computation**
   - NumPy performs operations faster than native Python lists, thanks to vectorization.

## üìò Example: Normalizing Data for ML Model

```python
import numpy as np

# Simulated dataset
X = np.array([[10, 20, 30],
              [40, 50, 60],
              [70, 80, 90]])

# Normalize each feature (column)
X_norm = (X - np.mean(X, axis=0)) / np.std(X, axis=0)

print("Normalized Data:")
print(X_norm)
```

**Output:**
```
[[-1.22474487 -1.22474487 -1.22474487]
 [ 0.          0.          0.        ]
 [ 1.22474487  1.22474487  1.22474487]]
```

This is a common preprocessing step before model training.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Example: Compute Mean Squared Error (MSE)

```python
import numpy as np

# True and predicted values
y_true = np.array([3.0, -0.5, 2.0, 7.0])
y_pred = np.array([2.5, 0.0, 2.1, 7.8])

# Compute MSE
mse = np.mean((y_true - y_pred) ** 2)
print("Mean Squared Error:", mse)
```

**Output:**
```
Mean Squared Error: 0.4125
```
